###General info

**FCT TV** is an idea for a campus' TV at FCT-UNL, which will satisfy the student's needs and raise the awareness for the interesting events that are offered every day.

Our solution has 4 different parts:

* Ruby on Rails Web server (this one)
* <a href="https://github.com/gdiasdasilva/FCT-TV-TVClient" target="_blank">TV Client</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/gdiasdasilva/python-crawlers" target="_blank">Information crawlers (in Python)</a>
* iPhone app

##Description

The Web Server for FCT TV is like a social network. The students are the users and they can post information in the webpage that in the future will be shown in the TV's that are running the TV Client component.

It was developed in Ruby on Rails 4 and offers features like tags, markdown publications, insertion of videos and images alongside the text, and many more.
